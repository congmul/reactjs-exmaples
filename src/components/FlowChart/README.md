## Terms
In the docs we are using the following terms for the parts of a flow:

 - Node: A node is a draggable block that can be connected with other nodes.
 - Edge: An edge is a connection between two nodes.
 - Handle: A handle is a kind of port of a node that is used to connect nodes. You start a connection at a handle and end it on another one.
 - Connection Line: The connection line is the line that gets drawn while you connect two nodes with each other.
 - Transform: Used to describe the current viewport of the pane. It's an array with three numbers: [x, y, zoom].
